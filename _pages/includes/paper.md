 *Intro*:We exploit more than 2.8 million government procurement contracts during 2014-2021, and develop a novel method to measure the quality of contract.Using the Budget Law reform in China as a quasi-natural experiment, this paper examines the causal impact of Use-it-or-lose-it budget rules on local governments year-end spending spikes.  

- **Yuchen Guo, Matthew O. Jackson, and Ruixue Jia**. “*Comrades and Cause: Peer Influence on West Point Cadets' Civil War Allegiances*”. working paper, NBER.
*Intro*:We examine how peers influence the allegiances of West Point cadets in the American Civil War. Specifically, we analyze how quasi-random variations in the proportion of cadets from northern (low-slave) states influenced the decisions of cadets in choosing which army to join. A higher proportion of classmates from low-slave states significantly increased the likelihood that cadets from high-slave states joined the Union Army, while almost all cadets from low-slave states joined the Union Army (if they decided to join the war). Additionally, the higher the fraction of the population that were slaves in a cadet’s home state the lower the likelihood that
the cadet joined the Union and the lower the peer influence. We also examine how cadets’ decisions affected their military rank and career outcomes. Our results highlight the importance of peer influence in major life decisions, particularly at critical historical junctures.


- Yuchen Guo, Chenglin Li and pinghan Liang. “*Why is there so much surveillance in China——an explanation from a fiscal perspective*”.  ***American Economic Journal: Applied Economic*** &nbsp; **Submit**

*Intro*:We based on over 4.4 million government procurement announcement information, and uses semi supervised deep learning algorithms to collect traffic monitoring equipment procurement announcement data from 2014 to 2019, examining the impact of local fiscal pressure on traffic monitoring installation. Whether local governments will install more surveillance equipment in order to generate revenue from fines, when hit by financial shocks.

 - Yuchen Guo, Qilin Huang and pinghan Liang. “*Presidents’ Heel: Hometown Biases and (Mis)allocation of Chinese Universities Funds*”.
  
*Intro*: In a top-down bureaucracy, the allocation of university funds is influenced by power. This paper utilizes the public procurement contracts of all Chinese elite universities, and examines the impact of leaders turnover on university procurement. We find that after the appointment of a new president, this university procures significantly more from the suppliers in the president’s hometowns. These procurements tend to be of low quality. We suggest this is due to presidents’ hometown favoritism. Our results demonstrate the distortions of university funds and contribute to understanding the efficiency of R&D spending in China.
