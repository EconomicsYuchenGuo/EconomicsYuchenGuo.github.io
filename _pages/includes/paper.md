- Guo Yuchen, Huang Qilin and Liang pinghan. “*Presidents’ Heel: Hometown Biases and (Mis)allocation of Chinese Universities Funds*”.
  
*Intro*: In a top-down bureaucracy, the allocation of university funds is influenced by power. This paper utilizes the public procurement contracts of all Chinese elite universities, and examines the impact of leaders turnover on university procurement. We find that after the appointment of a new president, this university procures significantly more from the suppliers in the president’s hometowns. These procurements tend to be of low quality. We suggest this is due to presidents’ hometown favoritism. Our results demonstrate the distortions of university funds and contribute to understanding the efficiency of R&D spending in China.
